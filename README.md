# üè∫ nilus

Nilus is a command for writing Ancient (polytonic) Greek with a Latin keyboard. It reads command-line arguments or `stdin` and allows you to use all of those pesky accents and diacritics not usually allowed with a Greek keyboard.

This is done through the [Beta Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Code) standard.

Usage:

```
nilus [TEXT]... (also accepts input from STDIN)

Usage of nilus:
  -n	Don't print a newline when argumentss are passed
```
